# 📝 basic-tokenizer-nltk-llm
This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a **text tokenizer** using:
- **NLTK** → for simple word/sentence tokenization  
- **Hugging Face Tokenizers** → to show how LLMs encode text into IDs and decode back  

💡 I built this project to learn **NLP basics** and how **Large Language Models** handle tokenization.

## 🚀 Features
- Tokenize text into words & sentences using NLTK  
- Encode text into IDs using Hugging Face tokenizers  
- Decode IDs back into text  
- Beginner-friendly & well-commented code

## 🔍 Example Run

**Hello! My name is Hiba Siddiqui. You're viewing my repository of a basic tokenizer. I've recently learned some features and was doing a course on LLM basics from there. This idea came to my mind to build my project on tokenizer and to know how it works.**

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand NLP tokenization
- Learn how LLMs assign IDs to tokens
- Practice GitHub workflow
- Share my first NLP project with others

## 🛠 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hibasiddiqui117/basic-tokenizer-nltk-llm.git
cd basic-tokenizer-nltk-llm
